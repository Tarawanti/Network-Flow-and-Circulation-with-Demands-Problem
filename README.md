# Network-Flow-and-Circulation-with-Demands-Problem
# To Execute Advanced Algorithms, Project 1 - Network Flow and
Circulation with Demands Problem

1. The source code and test cases should be in the same folder.
2. There should be a blank line for sink. If sink is the last node, there should be
a blank line before EOF (End of File).
3. Inputs for Breadth First Search and Ford Fulkerson Algorithm, each line
should contain paired (node, weight) values separated by spaces, any values
without a pair (weight) should be discarded.
4. Input for Circulation problem should be demand followed by node and
weight. Negative entries will consider as supply and positive entries as
demands.
